# Level Design: Levels 1–5

Coordinate system:
- Vertical progression from bottom (0%) to top (100%)
- Horizontal axis from left (0%) to right (100%)
- Safe channels define navigable space
- Walls are invisible, revealed only via ripple interaction

---

## Level 1 — Straight Confidence
Purpose: teach movement and ripple reading.

- Safe channel width: 60%
- Channel centered at x=50%
- Gentle curve between 40–70% height
- No traps

---

## Level 2 — Soft S-Curve
Purpose: introduce deliberate steering.

- Safe channel width: 50%
- Lane center follows an S curve:
  - 0–30%: x=45%
  - 30–60%: x=60%
  - 60–100%: x=45%
- Calm pocket at 55% height (wider zone)

---

## Level 3 — First Pinch
Purpose: precision and speed control.

- Base width: 50%
- Pinch zone:
  - 40–55% height
  - Width narrows to 28%
- Pinch centered at x=50%

---

## Level 4 — Choice Split
Purpose: introduce routing without punishment.

- Initial width: 65%
- Split at 35% height:
  - Left route: x=15–45%, width 30%
  - Right route: x=55–85%, width 30%
- Routes rejoin at 75% height

---

## Level 5 — Bait Pocket
Purpose: first real puzzle moment.

- Main lane: x=25–75%, width 50%
- Tempting side pocket at 45% height:
  - Right-side pocket leads to dead end
- Escape possible only if player retreats early
