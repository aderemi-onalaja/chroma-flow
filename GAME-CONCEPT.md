CHROMA FLOW (working title)

Feel your way forward.
A minimalist, addictive, colour-first vertical puzzle runner inspired by the Miniclip era.

High concept

CHROMA FLOW is a one-touch (or drag) vertical ascent game: the player moves upward through an invisible maze inside a single full-screen colour per level. There is no visible character — only ripples and distortions reveal movement and collisions, making the game feel physical and “real”.

Core hook

You don’t see the maze — you feel it through ripple physics.
	•	Full-screen, single-colour level
	•	Invisible corridors and walls
	•	Movement creates ripples
	•	Collisions reveal edges via distortion/highlight
	•	A right-side progress “spine” shows how close you are to completion

Player movement

Inspired by Snake’s “navigation pressure”, but evolved:
	•	Player is always progressing upward
	•	Player can steer left/right (drag)
	•	No avatar, no trail-body — only temporal ripple wake
	•	Optional rule: stopping increases distortion / instability → failure

Level structure
	•	Start with 100 levels
	•	Each level = one colour identity (memory by colour, not number)
	•	Difficulty ramps via:
	•	Narrower paths
	•	Faster required ascent
	•	False openings / bait routes
	•	Ripple “noise” overload (harder to read)

UI (minimal)
	•	Right-side vertical progress indicator (“spine”)
	•	Fills bottom → top
	•	Subtle pulse synced to music
	•	Near completion: pulse tightens, audio tension rises

No numbers, no timers, no clutter.

Audio feel (important)
	•	Ripples affect sound: subtle low-pass / resonance on heavy distortion
	•	Near completion: higher intensity + tighter rhythm
	•	Failure: implodes / collapses inward (not an explosion)

Colour system

100 levels = 100 moods. Colour isn’t flat:
	•	Ripple refraction creates dynamic depth
	•	Collision grazes briefly brighten edges
	•	Gentle gradient drift as you ascend

Suggested progression:
	•	1–10: soft pastels (learn)
	•	11–30: saturated primaries (confidence)
	•	31–60: dark/in tones (precision)
	•	61–90: neon/high contrast (intensity)
	•	91–100: near-monochrome “brutal” mastery

Why it’s addictive
	•	One mechanic → endless mastery
	•	Hypnotic feedback loop (motion → ripples → information)
	•	Fast retries, high “one more go” energy
	•	You improve by feel, not by memorising UI
