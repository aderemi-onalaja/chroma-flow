# CHROMA FLOW
**Feel your way forward.**

CHROMA FLOW is a minimalist, colour-first vertical puzzle runner inspired by the Miniclip era. Each level fills the entire screen with a single colour. The player moves upward through an invisible maze, guided only by ripple effects and distortion.

There is no visible character. Movement, collision, and failure are communicated through physics-driven ripples that make the environment feel real.

## Core Hook
You don’t see the maze — you feel it.

- Full-screen single-colour levels
- Invisible corridors and walls
- Movement generates ripples
- Collisions reveal geometry through distortion
- Progress shown via a subtle right-side indicator

---

## Player Movement
- Continuous vertical ascent
- Horizontal steering via touch or drag
- No avatar or body — only a temporal ripple wake
- Optional rule: stopping increases instability → failure

---

## Level Structure
- 100 levels to start
- Each level defined by a unique colour identity
- Difficulty increases via:
  - Narrower paths
  - Faster ascent pressure
  - False openings
  - Increased ripple noise

---

## UI Philosophy
- No numbers
- No timers
- No text during play

Only:
- A right-side vertical progress spine
- Subtle pulse synced to audio
- Increased tension near completion

---

## Audio & Feedback
- Ripples subtly affect sound (low-pass / resonance)
- Completion ramps energy
- Failure collapses inward instead of exploding

---

## Why It’s Addictive
- One mechanic, infinite mastery
- Hypnotic feedback loop
- Fast retries
- Improvement through feel, not memorisation
